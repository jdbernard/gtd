<td class="docs"><h1>Jonathan Bernard's Getting Things Done implementation.</h1><p>This is my adaptation of the Getting Things Done system by David Allen. There are a lot of tools that adapt his system for various digital platforms, but most of them move away from the folder-based system he created. They try to create new systems based on the core principles of the method outlined in <a href="https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GETTING-THINGS-DONE-PAPERBACK-p-16175.php"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a>, but I was unable to find a system that followed the details of his method. I do not think there is anything wrong with reimagining the system based on the core principles. David Allen advocates that in the book himself. Still, I was very attracted to the folder-based implementation that he descibes; I only wanted to use digital folders and files instead of physical folders and pages.</p><h2>History and Motivation</h2><p>My method initially started as a simple collection of folders, intended to mirror the physical system. As I used this I noticed some common use patterns that would benefit from an automated tool. In particular, I wanted to have the system walk my through the <em>process</em> phase. It was too easy for me to forget some of the important principles of this phase: immediately doing anything that could be done in 5 minutes or less, identifying the next action for an item, and sorting the action correctly. Out of this the <a href="src/main/com/jdblabs/gtd/cli/GTDCLI.groovy.html#gtd.jdb-labs.com/cli/GTDCLI">command-line tool</a> was born.</p><p>As I started using the system for everything I started desiring to have some way to publish my plans (or at least some contexts of my plans, like work). This lead me to implement a <a href="src/main/com/jdblabs/gtd/servlet/GTDServlet.groovy.html#gtd.jdb-labs.com/servlet/GTDServlet">REST API</a> that interfaced with the repository (still just files) so that I could easily embed this information in a web page, or allow controlled access to the system from a client application.</p><h2>How It Works</h2><p><em>TODO</em></p><h2>Code Index</h2><h3>com.jdblabs.gtd</h3>
